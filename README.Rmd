# Observable JS Gallery

This repo aims to pool together basic and more complex examples of how [Observable](https://observablehq.com/tutorials) works inside [Quarto](https://quarto.org) document to render (interactive) plots.

The rendered version can be seen [here](https://abichat.github.io/ojs-gallery/).
